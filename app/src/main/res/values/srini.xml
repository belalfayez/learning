    <!-- Note to language dude or dame —
        Each array lists things Srini might say in the contexts described one by one below.
        App will pick one option at random at any given time. You can include as many different 
        "lines" as come to mind, or as few as one. Each line should be natural, casual, &
        idiomatic. What would a young adult or teenager say to a slightly younger person in these
        contexts in the language and culture You working with? --> 
    <!-- You can include alternatives from different dialects, as long as each line can be
        generally understood by all speakers of the language at large. --> 
    <!-- Some lines is used more often than others in real life. You can get Srini to use certain
        lines more than others by including the more common lines more than once (in the relevant
        array). -->
